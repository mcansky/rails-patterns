# rails-patterns
A way to share patterns used in Rails app, in documented way.

## Reasons

Over the years different school of thought have appeared in the RubyOnRails community about how to write, maintain and document RoR apps. This repository is a starting point to document a few different approaches so that members of the community can read about those, pick them up to use or influence their own patterns with them.

## Format

Let's start with simple markdown files with included snippets of code when needed. One folder per approach, give it a name be it yours, your company's or a made one.

The main point is to describe the additional layers you tend to use, with their names, potentially related libraries (gems) and possible design patterns related to them.

Typically this is something that would be shown on day 1 to new starters in a team "here, that's how we do RubyOnRails apps here".

## Adding your pattern

1. fork the repo
2. create a branch
3. create a folder and a README.md in there
4. type to your heart's content
5. push your branch, create a PR
